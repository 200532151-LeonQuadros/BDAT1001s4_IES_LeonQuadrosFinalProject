6,"FED ' S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by permitting formation of financial services holding companies involved in areas like banking , insurance , real estate and securities . In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank and Financial Analysts ' Association , Heller said , "" I believe that increased diversification along geographic and product lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system ."" He said he supported the idea of financial services holding companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding Companies in which regulation of various bank , thrift , insurance , investment , securities and real estate subsidiaries would be handled on functional lines . "" Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the bank to the associated institutions , and all transactions would have to be on an arms - length basis ,"" Heller said . Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks ' special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries . Heller said he "" would require the holding company to serve as a ' source of strength ' to the bank by making a commitment to maintain the bank ' s capital . "" In other words , the bank would not be allowed to fail as long as the holding company has a positive net worth ."" Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company , again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary . Heller said the effects of these actions "" would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them "" in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to "" loot the bank "" was removed . Such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the United States . Heller said that would mean "" the steady decline of America ' s banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested "" by permitting them to become more competitive ."

13,"BP & lt ; BP > DOES NOT PLAN TO HIKE STANDARD & lt ; SRD > BID British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co , BP Managing Director David Simon said . "" We don ' t seen this as any progressive bidding game ,"" he told reporters at a news conference . BP now owns 55 pct of Standard ' s stock . Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst , whom he would not identify , as saying BP ' s careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer . "" I think that ( an increase ) would be totally wrong . I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation ,"" he said . "" Let ' s wait and see how the offer runs ."" Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid . The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7 . 2 times Standard ' s 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company ' s assets , including the value of its oil , natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves . He said the price Royal Dutch / Shell Group & lt ; RD > & lt ; SC > paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5 . 1 times cash flow . The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard ' s stock price over the past year . BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two - third ' s of the 7 . 4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources . The rest will be financed by new debt . BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit , he explained . The company ' s debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed , Chase said . But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months , he added . Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil ' s publicly held shares are held by financial institutions . Simon said Standard ' s board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time . He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition . "" We have informed Washington of our intentions and we ' ve already been an integral part of ownership of U . S . oil reserves ,"" he pointed out . Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained , and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production . "" We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime ,"" Simon said . "" We have hopes for greater stability , but we do not see prices going much higher ,"" he added ."

24,"BP & lt ; BP > MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID - ANALYSTS British Petroleum Co PLC may have to raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly traded shares of Standard Oil Co & lt ; SRD >, analysts said . "" There ' s a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid ,"" said Rosario Ilaqua of L . F . Rothschild . And despite BP managing director David Simon ' s denial today that BP would raise the offer , the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility . Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch / Shell Group ' s & lt ; RD > & lt ; SC > bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985 . Royal Dutch / Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share , after lawsuits by minority shareholders . "" I think they ' re going to have to go a little higher eventually , just as Royal Dutch / Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares ,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said . He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share . Royal Dutch / Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30 . 5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984 . After objections from minority shareholders about the price , Royal Dutch / Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984 . But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer . After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil , Royal Dutch / Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase . It ended up paying 5 . 67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake , a significant premium to its original bid of about 5 . 2 billion dlrs . The analysts made their comments before Simon ' s remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon . Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible . The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share . Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch / Shell group precedent . But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason , they said .

Last year , the report noted , the cash flow from operations dropped to 1 . 8 billion dlrs from 3 . 5 billion dlrs in 1985 and 3 . 2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices . The report , prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc & lt ; BP > disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard ' s stock , put 1987 capital spending at 1 . 6 billion dlrs , down from the 1 . 7 billion dlrs projected in January .

The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2 . 41 billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2 . 65 billion barrels a year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11 . 4 mln barrels last year from 23 . 2 mln in 1985 .

It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct , a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said . In a letter sent yesterday , Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told U . S . Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U . S . Firms that have expressed interest . But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role , he said . The move appears to be an effort to dampen U . S .

K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L >, industry analysts and diplomats said .

Merrill Lynch and Co Inc & lt ; MER > and Pacific Telesis International Inc & lt ; PAC >, both of the U . S ., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively . The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor . It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier , such as Cable and Wireless , arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists . Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy , Jonathan Solomon , yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless ' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct , the ministry official said . Channeling the U . S . Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless ' share , industry analysts said .

Leverage may get the total foreign share up to a certain amount , but you won ' t find any one company with an extraordinarily large holding ,"" Whitten said . Western diplomatic sources were more blunt .

123,"AMERICAN EXPRESS & lt ; AXP > SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc , but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock . American Express stock got a lift from the rumor , as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value , thereby boosting the total value of American Express . The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend . American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72 - 5 / 8 , up 4 - 1 / 8 on heavy volume . American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity . Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts ' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes . At the meeting , company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson , according to analysts . Yesterday , Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer , Jeffery Lane , to the added position of president , which had been vacant . It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions . Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense , contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff . Some analysts , however , disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express , contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year . "" I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson ,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical . He questioned what would be a better investment than "" a very profitable securities firm ."" Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash , which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset . But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson , and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market . Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential - Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past . "" Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place . Shearson ' s book value is in the 1 . 4 mln dlr range . Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3 . 5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization ,"" said Eckenfelder . Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally . "" They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital . You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road ,"" said E . F . Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis . "" They ' ve outlined the fact that they ' re investing heavily in the future , which goes heavily into the international arena ,"" said Lewis . ""... That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way ,"" he said . Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson , its stock might better reflect other assets , such as the travel related services business . "" It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage . The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company ,"" he said . Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after - tax operating earnings , up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985 ."

Department of Transportation ( DOT ) said it gave final clearance to the proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American Airlines Inc . "" The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest ,"" the DOT said in a statement . AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a unit of AMR Corp . The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan Feb . 20 . American is the third largest U . S . airline in terms of revenue passenger miles while AirCal -- a relatively small carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities -- is the nation ' s 17th largest passenger carrier . Their merger would not alter American ' s third - place ranking , according to data compiled by Aviation Daily , a leading industry trade magazine . The combination would incrase American ' s share of the U . S . market to 15 . 4 pct from its current 14 . 7 pct , the DOT said . The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers provide either nonstop or single - plane service . At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers , the DOT said it found no evidence that other carriers could not increase or begin service that competed with a merged American - AirCal . Concerning the 14th , "" While entry may not be possible at the Orange County Airport in the near future , DOT found that the service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area , especially at the Los Angeles International Airport , will provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in long - haul markets ,"" the DOT said . The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County terminal , where environmental concerns and a small terminal building limit future opportunities for expansion . The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments opposing the merger but "" raised no new facts or arguments .""

"" The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float ,"" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement . Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership . With the sale , CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier , he said .

S > has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business , share analysts said . "" It sounds like a good deal ,"" Stuart McKibbin of & lt ; A . C . Goode and Co > told Reuters . CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the & lt ; Delhi Australia Fund > and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp & lt ; XON > unit & lt ; Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc > for 985 mln dlrs . In a twin announcement CSR , already Australia ' s largest sugar refiner , made a 2 . 20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in & lt ; Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd >. "" This will be a big shock to the market , which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi ,"" McKibbin said . A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs , but in opting to sell outright , CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best - performing divisions of sugar and building products , analysts said . CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U . S . Dlrs a barrel in the next two years . Delhi is one of Australia ' s largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin . Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs . Neale Goldston - Morris of Sydney broker & lt ; Bain and Co Ltd > said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian - owned assets to a foreign company . "" The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans ,"" Goldston - Morris said . The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia ' s 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country , analysts said . They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices . Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year , they said . Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment , made in 1981 , which has dragged down the company ' s overall performance , analysts said . CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U . S . Dlr investment financed entirely from U . S . Dollar debt , they said . "" It was a bad investment for them . They financed it entirely with debt , the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them ,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker & lt ; Meares and Philips Ltd > said . Esso not only picked up Delhi ' s oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions . Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50 / 50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd & lt ; BRKN . S >.

199,"TALKING POINT / BORG - WARNER CORP & lt ; BOR > Borg - Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp ' s 46 - dlr - per - share takeover offer , but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer , either from GAF or its own management , analysts believe . Analysts also said Borg - Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring . The speculation pushed Borg - Warner ' s stock up 1 - 3 / 8 to 48 - 1 / 2 in heavy trading . Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg - Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF . "" It seems from at least their dealing with ( raider Irwin ) Jacobs that they don ' t want to be taken over . The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF . I think instinctively , they want to remain independent ,"" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps . Borg - Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year . Last week , Jacobs ' investment vehicle , Minstar Inc , and an investor group sold its 10 . 1 mln Borg - Warner shares . The same day , GAF Corp raised its stake by 9 . 1 mln shares to 19 . 9 pct of the outstanding . Jacobs was interested in buying the company , but took no steps toward a transaction . "" Their ( Borg - Warner ) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months . It ' s been one of the dullest corporate battles I ' ve seen ,"" said one analyst . The battle , however , has heated up , and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share . Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate . Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3 . 16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg - Warner . Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg - Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way . Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp , but GAF benefited from that company ' s restructuring . "" Borg Warner can ' t quibble that it ' s not a legitimate offer . It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place . They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it ' s sweetened . I personally think the company is ( worth ) around 55 dlrs per share ,"" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson . Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith . The company bought back the financier ' s stock and carried out a wider share repurchase . Arbitragers , however , said they do not believe Heyman is seeking "" greenmail ,"" or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium . Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction . Previously associated with "" junk bond "" experts , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc , GAf said it would finance its Borg - Warner takeover with bank financing . GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg - WArner board and conditioned on the board ' s recommendation of the tender offer and merger . Heyman said in a letter to Borg - Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg - Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap . Analysts , however , believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction . GAF ' s stock rose 1 - 5 / 8 today , to 48 - 5 / 8 . "" I believe , obviously , if GAF takes over Borg - Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially ,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose . He said at 46 dlrs per share , Heyman ' s average cost for the company ' s stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF ' s current holdings . Rose said the Borg - Warner plastics and chemical business , which makes thermo - plastics is the asset attracting Heyman . Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg ' s earnings . The plastics are used in telephone equipment , office equipment and appliances . "" Borg has half the market in the U . S . and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator ,"" Rose said . Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co & lt ; DOW > and Monsanto Corp & lt ; MTC >, he said . Borg - Warner also has an automotive parts business , and a protective systems business , which includes Wells Fargo security guards . It also has an information services business , and is trying to sell its financial services business . Borg - Warner earned 206 . 1 mln dlrs or 2 . 35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3 . 62 billion dlrs in 1986 . Smaller GAF , in 1986 , earned on an operating basis 80 . 7 mln dlrs or 2 . 22 dlrs per share on sales of 753 . 8 mln dlrs . GAF ' s net earnings included an after tax gain of 201 . 4 mln from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer , a special union carbide dividend , and the sale of its Union Carbide shares ."

252,"U . S . SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA - WESTERN MERGER U . S . Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta & lt ; DAL > Airlines Inc and Western Airlines & lt ; WAL >, the Court said . O ' Connor ' s action came hours after a three - judge panel of the 9th U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration . A Supreme Court spokesman said O ' Connor granted a stay of the injuction , allowing the merger , worth nearly 860 mln dlrs , to go through as planned later today . The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details . Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment . The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta - based Delta , which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western , which has headquartera in Los Angeles . "" Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight ,"" Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night . "" There was really very little that remained to be done ."" The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western ' s management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place . The airlines argued that Western ' s promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company . After learning of the appeals court ruling , Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uniforms , not in new Delta outfits . Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western . The merger took place in December , and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then . The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night . At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines . While all but eight pct of Western ' s 11 , 000 employees are unionized , only Delta ' s pilots are union members . Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters , as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be "" extinguished "" after today ."

Conrac , which said its board discussed the alternatives at special meetings on March 26 and 30 , said that its decision on whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "" the future actions of Mark IV "" and its unsolicitied tender offer . Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer , it said . Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it becomes final , the company said . The board also took other defensive steps , including granting severance agreements to some officers , it said . At a board meeting yesterday , Concac ' s directors deleted a provision allowing the holder of at least one - third of of all classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to remove directors without cause , the company said . The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority of the company ' s common stock in the offer , Conrac said . Conrac ' s president , vice president and treasurer were given severance agreements , or "" golden parachutes ,"" it said . Under the agreements , Conrac President Paul Graf would get a cash payment of twice his annual salary , which was 209 , 906 dlrs last year , if there were a change of control in the company , including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the company ' s voting stock , Conrac said . Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph O ' Donnell , who made 143 , 325 dlrs last year , would get one - and - a - half times his salary if there were a change in control . Smorada ' s salary was not listed in the SEC filing . The executives would also get cash settlements of options plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits ."

309,"TALKING POINT / PUROLATOR COURIER & lt ; PCC > Emery Air Freight Corp topped a leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs , but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface . Purolator ' s stock climbed 5 - 3 / 8 today , to 40 - 1 / 8 , 1 / 4 over Emery ' s 40 dlr per share offer . Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E . F . Hutton LBO Inc . Some analysts said the latest , 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations . Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range . At least one , however , estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share . Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made , but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher . "" They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer . Emery has shown the courage to go forth ,"" said one arbitrager , who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders . "" It makes sense ,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey . But "" It won ' t make out as well as they think . They won ' t get a 100 pct of the synergies ."" Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term , but long term , after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets , it should boost Emery ' s profitability . Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U . S . package delivery company after Federal Express Corp & lt ; FDX >, which has 47 pct of the market . Parker speculated that the combined Emery - Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business . "" This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight ( delivery ) business , but it will not make them a power house ,"" said Douglas Arthur of Kidder , Peabody and Co . Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer , and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call . E . F . Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer , but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST . One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer . However , he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company . Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E . F . Hutton Group & lt ; EFH > subsidiary , speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come . The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member , Doresy Gardner resigned in March . Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity . A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery , nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator . Purolator ' s deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week , which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth . Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday . Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator . Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr "" bridge "" loan that would later be replaced with other debt . Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator . Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan . Emery last year lost 5 . 4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887 . 5 mln dlrs . Purolator lost 57 . 6 mln dlrs on 841 . 4 mln dlrs in revenues ."

Edelman had no comment on the rumors . A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company . "" There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak ,"" analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said . Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out - of - court settlement . The suit , filed by Polaroid in April 1976 , charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid ' s instant camera patent . In October 1985 , the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent , the Polaroid spokesman said . Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow ' s hearing . Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on .
